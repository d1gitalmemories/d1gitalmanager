# Requirements:
- Roblox Client ID and Secret Key
- Discord Bot Token
- VPNAPI.io API Key (line 135 main.py)

Put everything except VPNAPI key in config.json
You need a hosting service, I suggest https://bot-hosting.net/ with cheap prices, as well as easy to setup domain.
You need A DOMAIN with SSL certificate. (Roblox OAuth2 App Requirement to do so)
Then, change all URLs (auth.d1gitalmemories.fun) to yours.
Change PORT at the end of the code with yours.
